\# DarkBit Wi-Fi Pentesting Toolkit v3.1

\*"Invisible in the noise, inevitable in the system."\*



---



\## 📌 Overview

The \*\*DarkBit Wi-Fi Pentesting Toolkit\*\* is a modular, Bash-based framework for \*\*authorized security testing and Wi-Fi auditing\*\*.  

It is designed to be simple, extensible, and professional — think of it as a lightweight, open-source framework that grows with your workflow.  



\*\*⚠️ Ethical Use Only:\*\*  

This toolkit is intended for \*\*lab testing, education, and authorized pentests\*\*.  

Do \*\*not\*\* use it on networks without \*\*explicit written permission\*\*.

\## 🚀 Features

\- Modular system — drop new `.sh` files into `/modules/` and they auto-load  

\- Logging of all activity into `/logs/`  

\- Config file (`toolkit.conf`) for interface/wordlist customization  

\- Defensive audit module (WPA3, PMF, WPS checks)  

\- Reporting module for quick summaries  

\- Expandable — supports scanning, handshake capture, cracking (placeholders), cleanup

\## ⚙️ Installation

Clone or copy this repo into your test environment:



```bash

git clone https://github.com/darkbit-labs/darkbit-toolkit.git

cd darkbit-toolkit

chmod +x darkbit.sh



▶️ Usage



Run the toolkit with root privileges:

sudo ./darkbit.sh



* The framework will:
* Load all modules from /modules/
* Build a dynamic menu
* Execute your chosen module
* Log all activity in /logs/



🧩 Adding New Modules



To add new functionality:

Create a .sh file in /modules/



Define three variables:



NAME="Module Name"

DESCRIPTION="Short explanation"

run() {

&nbsp; # Your code here

}



Save it → it appears automatically in the toolkit menu



✅ Example:



\# modules/example.sh

NAME="Example Module"

DESCRIPTION="Prints a test message"

run() {

&nbsp; echo "\[+] This is a test module!"

}



📋 Example Modules

1. Scan Networks → Passive Wi-Fi scan, save results
2. Handshake Capture (Placeholder) → Framework ready for lab capture
3. Crack Handshake (Placeholder) → Framework ready for cracking
4. Defensive Audit → Check router/AP for WPA3, PMF, WPS
5. Generate Report → Summarize logs into a report
6. Cleanup → Restore network manager



🔐 Disclaimer



This toolkit is for educational and authorized penetration testing only.

Misuse against unauthorized targets may violate laws.

Always test in lab environments or with explicit written consent.



🛠 Roadmap



* &nbsp;WPA3 testing module (lab mode)
* &nbsp;Evil Twin simulation (lab mode)
* &nbsp;WPS audit placeholder
* &nbsp;Automated reporting (HTML/PDF export)
* &nbsp;Live defense module (deauth/rogue AP detection)
