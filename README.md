# 🕶️ Hacking_Stuff  

Welcome to **Hacking_Stuff** – my personal stash of hacker notes, cheat sheets, experiments, and random chaos that didn’t fit anywhere else.  

Think of it as my **digital backpack** 🎒 – you never know if you’ll pull out a WiFi hack, a random exploit, or just a badly written bash script at 3 AM.
